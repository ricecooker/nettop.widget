# Nettop Widget for Ubersicht

Widget that behaves similarly to the command line tool nettop to show how
your computer is using the network.  The widget is for Ubersicht, a desktop 
widget app for OSX.  Good for the curious or paranoid.

Currently the widget shows:
* What hosts you're connected to
* All active network interfaces
* All connections each application has open or listening

How this is useful:
* You can verify that your browser is using your VPN tunnel
* Are you running any unwanted servers or a backdoor?
* See who's connected to you

How this is useless:
* Hostname lookups are reverse dns lookups so it might not tell you much.  For example *all* google services run off of 1e100.net
* Can only spot really poorly written malware
